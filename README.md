## Roadmap

- **Server**
    - Make an endpoint to download a git repo and kick all this junk off It will need to cache stuff like cray cray as it will be intensive
    - Grep for more files than just javascript files
    - Make the blame file return a method that can be used
    - Make the blame file work with external directories
- **Client**
